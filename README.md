# Groupify
Random group generator

So what I am essentially making is a website where you can have upload and/or upload your excel files or maybe even csv files (this I will add later for sure) and be able to get a refined excel file that has divided the entities into the number of times the user needs.

# If you're new to python and flask...
If you wanna run this code on your machine you have to have the following 
 - Have python installed on your machine
 - Ensure that the python package manager os working properly (pip)
    You can do this by running pip --version in your terminal emulator
 - Using pip install the following
    flask
    pandas
    numpy
 - Then run the python file and there you have it
 
I am still not yet done as of now.
